We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly ***salary x months*** worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as `2` space-separated integers.

**Input Format**

The Employee table containing employee data for a company is described as follows:

![table image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/19629/1458557872-4396838885-ScreenShot2016-03-21at4.27.13PM.png)

where employee_id is an employee's ID number, name is their name, months is the total number of months they've been working for the company, and salary is their monthly salary.

**Sample Input**

**Sample Output**
```
69952 1
```

**Explanation**

The table and earnings data is depicted in the following diagram:

![explanation](https://s3.amazonaws.com/hr-challenge-images/19631/1458559218-9f37585c7a-ScreenShot2016-03-21at4.49.23PM.png)

The maximum earnings value is 69952. The only employee with earnings = 69952 is Kimberly, so we print the maximum earnings value (69952) and a count of the number of employees who have earned $69952 (which is 1) as two space-separated values.

### Solution
```sql
SELECT
    MAX(months * salary),
    COUNT(months * salary)
FROM
    Employee
WHERE
    (months * salary) = (
        SELECT
            MAX(months * salary)
        FROM
            Employee
    );
```
