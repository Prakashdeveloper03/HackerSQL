You did such a great job helping Julia with her last coding contest challenge that she wants you to work on this one, too!

The total score of a hacker is the sum of their maximum scores for all of the challenges. Write a query to print the hacker_id, name, and total score of the hackers ordered by the descending score. If more than one hacker achieved the same total score, then sort the result by ascending hacker_id. Exclude all hackers with a total score of `0` from your result.

**Input Format**

The following tables contain contest data:

Hackers: The hacker_id is the id of the hacker, and name is the name of the hacker.

Submissions: The submission_id is the id of the submission, hacker_id is the id of the hacker who made the submission, challenge_id is the id of the challenge for which the submission belongs to, and score is the score of the submission.

### Solution
```sql
SELECT
    h.hacker_id,
    h.name,
    sum(sscore)
FROM
    Hackers h
    INNER JOIN (
        SELECT
            s.hacker_id,
            max(score) AS sscore
        FROM
            Submissions s
        GROUP BY
            s.hacker_id,
            s.challenge_id
    ) st ON h.hacker_id = st.hacker_id
GROUP BY
    h.hacker_id,
    h.name
HAVING
    sum(sscore) > 0
ORDER BY
    sum(sscore) DESC,
    h.hacker_id ASC;
